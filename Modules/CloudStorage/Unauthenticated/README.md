# GCPBucketBrute

The unauthenticated module "unauth_bucketbrute" + some other small cloud storage functionality is taken mostly verbatim from the Rhino Security Labs tool located here: https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/GCPBucketBrute/blob/master/README.md. Not per the licensing this is not a formal endorsement of this tool.

This code includes:
    - Check_existence function in util_helpers.py
    - Much of the logic/printout for check_bucket_permissions in util_hepers.py
    - Pretty much verbatim copy/paste of the main tool code in Modules/CloudStorage/Unauthenticated/gcpbucketbrute_permutations.py
    - Most of the default wordlist at Modules/CloudStorage/utils/gcpbucketbrute_permutations.txt
